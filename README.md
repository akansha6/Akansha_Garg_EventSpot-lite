## Technologies Used

The application is built using **React**, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and styled with **CSS** to ensure a modern look. It utilizes **Create React App** as a boilerplate for setting up the project with zero configuration.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akansha6/Akansha_Garg_EventSpot-lite.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Akansha_Garg_EventSpot-lite
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start

5. **Open your browser** and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
  
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
  
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
  
- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
